## Zombie Epidemic

For your final exam, we will simulate a simple zombie epidemic. The structure is
 very similar to the homework assignment. You are given a <b>city</b> which is a
 list of strings, and each element represents the state of the <b>location</b>
 within the city.
<br>
Each of the <b>locations</b> is one of the three states:
<ol>
  <li>"Zx" - the location is occupied by a Zombie horde, where 'x' stands
  for the positive integer size of the horde. So, "Z2" means that there is a
  zombie horde of size 2.</li>
  <li>"H" - the location is occupied by a Human</li>
  <li>"_" - the location is empty</li>
</ol>

### Examples of potential cities
`["Z1", "Z2", "H", "_", "_", "H", "Z10"]`
